	abstract = {In developing the tools necessary for the study of complex manifolds, this comprehensive, well-organized treatment presents in its opening chapters a detailed survey of recent progress in four areas: geometry (manifolds with vector bundles), algebraic topology, differential geometry, and partial differential equations. Subsequent chapters then develop such topics as Hermitian exterior algebra and the Hodge *-operator, harmonic theory on compact manifolds, differential operators on a Kahler manifold, the Hodge decomposition theorem on compact Kahler manifolds, the Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations on Kahler manifolds, Griffiths's period mapping, quadratic transformations, and Kodaira's vanishing and embedding theorems. The third edition of this standard reference contains a new appendix by Oscar Garcia-Prada which gives an overview of certain developments in the field during the decades since the book first appeared. From reviews of the 2nd Edition:"..the new edition of Professor Wells' book is timely and welcome...an excellent introduction for any mathematician who suspects that complex manifold techniques may be relevant to his work." - Nigel Hitchin, Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society "Its purpose is to present the basics of analysis and geometry on compact complex manifolds, and is already one of the standard sources for this material." - Daniel M.

If 9 {\textasciitilde} 2, the moduli space of X depends on 3g - 3 complex parameters. Thus problems in one complex variable lead, from the very beginning, to studies in several complex variables. Complex tori and moduli spaces are complex manifolds, i.e. Hausdorff spaces with local complex coordinates Z 1, ... , Zn; holomorphic functions are, locally, those functions which are holomorphic in these coordinates. th In the second half of the 19 century, classical algebraic geometry was born in Italy. The objects are sets of common zeros of polynomials. Such sets are of finite dimension, but may have singularities forming a closed subset of lower dimension; outside of the singular locus these zero sets are complex manifolds.},

	abstract = {Complex Lie groups have often been used as auxiliaries in the study of real Lie groups in areas such as differential geometry and representation theory. To date, however, no book has fully explored and developed their structural aspects.The Structure of Complex Lie Groups addresses this need. Self-contained, it begins with general concepts introduced via an almost complex structure on a real Lie group. It then moves to the theory of representative functions of Lie groups- used as a primary tool in subsequent chapters-and discusses the extension problem of representations that is essential for studying the structure of complex Lie groups. This is followed by a discourse on complex analytic groups that carry the structure of affine algebraic groups compatible with their analytic group structure. The author then uses the results of his earlier discussions to determine the observability of subgroups of complex Lie groups.The differences between complex algebraic groups and complex Lie groups are sometimes subtle and it can be difficult to know which aspects of algebraic group theory apply and which must be modified. The Structure of Complex Lie Groups helps clarify those distinctions. Clearly written and well organized, this unique work presents material not found in other books on Lie groups and serves as an outstanding complement to them.},

	abstract = {This book was planned as an introduction to a vast area, where many contri butions have been made in recent years. The choice of material is based on my understanding of the role of Lie groups in complex analysis. On the one hand, they appear as the automorphism groups of certain complex spaces, e. g. , bounded domains in en or compact spaces, and are therefore important as being one of their invariants. On the other hand, complex Lie groups and, more generally, homoge neous complex manifolds, serve as a proving ground, where it is often possible to accomplish a task and get an explicit answer. One good example of this kind is the theory of homogeneous vector bundles over flag manifolds. Another example is the way the global analytic properties of homogeneous manifolds are translated into algebraic language. It is my pleasant duty to thank A. L. Onishchik, who first introduced me to the theory of Lie groups more than 25 years ago. I am greatly indebted to him and to E. B. Vinberg for the help and advice they have given me for years. I would like to express my gratitude to M. Brion, B. GilIigan, P. Heinzner, A. Hu kleberry, and E. Oeljeklaus for valuable discussions of various subjects treated here.

The most sensational one concerns the differentiable structure of surfaces. Twenty years ago very little was known about differentiable structures on 4-manifolds, but in the meantime Donaldson on the one hand and Seiberg and Witten on the other hand, have found, inspired by gauge theory, totally new invariants. Strikingly, together with the theory explained in this book these invariants yield a wealth of new results about the differentiable structure of algebraic surfaces. Other developments include the systematic use of nef-divisors (in ac­ cordance with the progress made in the classification of higher dimensional algebraic varieties), a better understanding of Kahler structures on surfaces, and Reider's new approach to adjoint mappings. All these developments have been incorporated in the present edition, though the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten theory only by way of examples. Of course we use the opportunity to correct some minor mistakes, which we ether have discovered ourselves or which were communicated to us by careful readers to whom we are much obliged.},

	abstract = {The golden age of mathematics-that was not the age of Euclid, it is ours. C. J. KEYSER This time of writing is the hundredth anniversary of the publication (1892) of Poincare's first note on topology, which arguably marks the beginning of the subject of algebraic, or "combinatorial," topology. There was earlier scattered work by Euler, Listing (who coined the word "topology"), Mobius and his band, Riemann, Klein, and Betti. Indeed, even as early as 1679, Leibniz indicated the desirability of creating a geometry of the topological type. The establishment of topology (or "analysis situs" as it was often called at the time) as a coherent theory, however, belongs to Poincare. Curiously, the beginning of general topology, also called "point set topology," dates fourteen years later when Frechet published the first abstract treatment of the subject in 1906. Since the beginning of time, or at least the era of Archimedes, smooth manifolds (curves, surfaces, mechanical configurations, the universe) have been a central focus in mathematics. They have always been at the core of interest in topology. After the seminal work of Milnor, Smale, and many others, in the last half of this century, the topological aspects of smooth manifolds, as distinct from the differential geometric aspects, became a subject in its own right.},

	abstract = {In most mathematics departments at major universities one of the three or four basic first-year graduate courses is in the subject of algebraic topology. This introductory textbook in algebraic topology is suitable for use in a course or for self-study, featuring broad coverage of the subject and a readable exposition, with many examples and exercises. The four main chapters present the basic material of the subject: fundamental group and covering spaces, homology and cohomology, higher homotopy groups, and homotopy theory generally. The author emphasizes the geometric aspects of the subject, which helps students gain intuition. A unique feature of the book is the inclusion of many optional topics which are not usually part of a first course due to time constraints, and for which elementary expositions are sometimes hard to find. Among these are: Bockstein and transfer homomorphisms, direct and inverse limits, H-spaces and Hopf algebras, the Brown representability theorem, the James reduced product, the Dold-Thom theorem, and a full exposition of Steenrod squares and powers. Researchers will also welcome this aspect of the book.},

(jbu) European Mathematical Society Newsletter, Sept. 2004, p. 44 "[...] This book is an excellent introduction to current research in the geometry of Calabi-Yau manifolds, hyper-K\"ahler manifolds, exceptional holonomy and mirror symmetry. [...] This is an excellent and useful book. The different chapters mostly fit together reasonably well [...]. It will be popular with anyone trying to learn about K\"ahler manifolds with c1=0 and mirror symmetry." Richard P. Thomas, Mathematical Reviews, Clippings from Issue 2004c "Summer schools in Nordfjordeid, Norway, have been organized regularly since 1996. … The school held in June 2001 was devoted to recent interaction between differential and algebraic geometry. The book consists of notes written by lecturers of the corresponding three series of lectures. … they give a nice introduction into a very interesting field of research on the border between mathematics and physics. I would like to strongly recommend the book to anybody interested in the topic."
