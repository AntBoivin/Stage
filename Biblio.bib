	abstract = {In developing the tools necessary for the study of complex manifolds, this comprehensive, well-organized treatment presents in its opening chapters a detailed survey of recent progress in four areas: geometry (manifolds with vector bundles), algebraic topology, differential geometry, and partial differential equations. Subsequent chapters then develop such topics as Hermitian exterior algebra and the Hodge *-operator, harmonic theory on compact manifolds, differential operators on a Kahler manifold, the Hodge decomposition theorem on compact Kahler manifolds, the Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations on Kahler manifolds, Griffiths's period mapping, quadratic transformations, and Kodaira's vanishing and embedding theorems. The third edition of this standard reference contains a new appendix by Oscar Garcia-Prada which gives an overview of certain developments in the field during the decades since the book first appeared. From reviews of the 2nd Edition:"..the new edition of Professor Wells' book is timely and welcome...an excellent introduction for any mathematician who suspects that complex manifold techniques may be relevant to his work." - Nigel Hitchin, Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society "Its purpose is to present the basics of analysis and geometry on compact complex manifolds, and is already one of the standard sources for this material." - Daniel M. Burns, Jr., Mathematical Reviews},

Les outils introduits sont alors utilisés pour décrire les familles analytiques de cycles dans un espace complexe donné, pour montrer les premières propriétés de stabilité de cette notion et pour donner quelques applications simples mais fondamentales de ces résultats. Ceci sera approfondi et complété dans le volume 2.},

	abstract = {Robin Hartshorne studied algebraic geometry with Oscar Zariski and David Mumford at Harvard, and with J.-P. Serre and A. Grothendieck in Paris. After receiving his Ph.D. from Princeton in 1963, Hartshorne became a Junior Fellow at Harvard, then taught there for several years. In 1972 he moved to California where he is now Professor at the University of California at Berkeley. He is the author of "Residues and Duality" (1966), "Foundations of Projective Geometry (1968), "Ample Subvarieties of Algebraic Varieties" (1970), and numerous research titles. His current research interest is the geometry of projective varieties and vector bundles. He has been a visiting professor at the College de France and at Kyoto University, where he gave lectures in French and in Japanese, respectively. Professor Hartshorne is married to Edie Churchill, educator and psychotherapist, and has two sons. He has travelled widely, speaks several foreign languages, and is an experienced mountain climber. He is also an accomplished amateur musician: he has played the flute for many years, and during his last visit to Kyoto he began studying the shakuhachi.},
